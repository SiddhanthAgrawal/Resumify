        Writing a rock solid resume that stands out has become a challenging task these days. Here are some tips written in a simple yet credible way that relieves you of the exhausting task to search through scores of websites!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="mainpoints"><b><em><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Suitable template</h3></em></b></span>
          <p>The first and foremost task you need to do is to select the best type of resume that fits your employement needs. And here are the 4 basic resume types/templates:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt class="types"><u><b>Chronological</b></u></dt>
            <dd>- Best for those with solid employement background</dd>
	          <dd>- Work history with current position at top</dd> 
	          <dd>- Full-time, part-time or volunteer work can also be included</dd>
            <dt class="types"><u><b>Functional</b></u></dt>
            <dd>- Focuses on skills & experience; de-emphasizes work history</dd>
	          <dd>- Preferred if there are lapses/gaps in employement/<dd>
	          <dd>- Beneficial to new graduates/ people in the middle of a career change</dd>
	          <dd>- Those with diverse occupation paths can find this helpful</dd>
            <dt class="types"><u><b>Combination</b></u></dt>
            <dd>- Both Chronological and Functional combined forms a Combination resume</dd>
            <dt class="types"><u><b>Targeted</b></u></dt>
            <dd>- Customized & specific to the position desired</dd>
	          <dd>- Work history, abilities, & education are reflections of the job requirements</dd>
	          <dd>- Tailor your skills & talents to match the company's culture</dd>
          </dl>
          <p></p>
          <p>Take some time and think about what suits your situation the most as this is a crucial decision!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mainpoints"><b><em><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Formatting</h3></em></b></span>
          <p>The next important thing is the appearance. You need to choose your fonts, colours and sizes in a very professional manner.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Standard Font size is 10 to 12 points.</li>
            <li>There needs to be atleast a 1" margin.</li>
            <li>Top 10 font styles used are:</li>
              <ol>
                <li class="fonts">Garamond</li>
                <li class="fonts">Calibri</li>
                <li class="fonts">Cambria</li>
                <li class="fonts">Georgia</li>
                <li class="fonts">Helvetica</li>
                <li class="fonts">Times New Roman</li>
                <li class="fonts">Arial</li>
                <li class="fonts">Palatino</li>
                <li class="fonts">Tahoma</li>
                <li class="fonts">Verdana</li>
              </ol>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </br>
        <li class="mainpoints"><b><em><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Skills!</h3></em></b></span>
          <p>Another important point is the skills section of your resume. Stating interpersonal skills is as important and necessary as stating technical skills. Some of them could be listed in the form of sources like podcasts or videos you made or participated. Showcase your writing and effective communication skills in the form of your resume. But don't forget to highlight your software skills and technical knowledge too!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mainpoints"><b><em><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Be Unique!</h3></em></b></span>
          <p>Be sure to include some unique talents or experiences or passions that you have which can make you stand out. Sometimes the employers like to learn a bit more about the you. But don't go and write a big essay or list!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mainpoints"><b><em><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Proofread!</h3></em></b></span>
          <p>Sometimes tiny errors creep into our documents no matter how cautious we may be. And these tiny mistakes could have a huge impact on getting a job. Therefore it is very important to proofread your resume before submitting it. Read it twice or thrice. Then give it to some other peers or experienced people to do it once again. You don't want to embarrass yourself by killing your chance of landing an interview due to a simple typo!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mainpoints"><em><b><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Keywords: Examine what the jobposting is specifically looking for</h3></em></b></span>
          <p> Job postings often have keywords that they require on a resume such as years of experience or certain coding language, and you should try to include these skills so that your chances of your resume being accept become higher than those who could not fill in an answer to meet those keywords. <p>
        </li>
        <li class="mainpoints"><em><b><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Include relevant information and put the most important information first</h3></em></b></span>
          <p> There will be many applicants handing in their resume attempting to obtain the same jobposting that you are. The resume is often the first step in elimiating a lot of the applicants; thus, it is crucial that your resume includes answers to the keywords on the jobposting (such as years of experience)as well as any information that may be relevant to the job, such as coding languages learned with years using it included. </p>
        </li>
        <li class="mainpoints"><em><b><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Do not lie about your skills on your resume</h3></em></b></span>
          <p> As much as we all would like to think that saying a lie or two in order to satisfy requirements (keywords) the lie may be the cause of your downfall, and it may not only be for that company depending if word spreads about your resume. </p>
        </li>
        <li class="mainpoints"> <b><em><span style="color: blue"><h3 class="title">Shorten the resume to, at most, three pages while answering/including all the necessary keywords and information</h3></em></b></span>
          <p> There is going to be a fierce compeition among applicants to get their applications accepted. Because there are so many, those looking for potiential employees will most likely not have enough time to look at every page and only the first page as it is quicker than flipping to another page. </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
